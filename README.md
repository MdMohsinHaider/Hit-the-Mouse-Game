## About the Game

**Hit the Mouse** is a simple, interactive web game where the player's goal is to hit (click) the mouse icons that randomly appear on the screen within a limited time frame. The game is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on quick reflexes and accuracy.

When the game starts, mice pop up at random positions inside the game area. Each mouse stays visible for one second. Players have to click on the mice before they disappear to increase their score. The game challenges reaction time and hand-eye coordination.

## History of the Game

The concept of "Hit the Mouse" is inspired by the classic "Whac-A-Mole" arcade game, which originated in the 1970s. This genre became popular due to its simple yet addictive gameplay, challenging players to hit randomly appearing targets quickly to score points. This web adaptation brings the excitement to browser environments with intuitive mouse interactions and responsive design for modern devices.

## Future Development

Planned improvements for future versions include:  
- Adding a countdown timer for timed rounds.  
- Levels with increasing difficulty (faster mouse spawn and shorter visibility).  
- Sound effects and animation for hits and misses.  
- Leaderboards to track high scores globally.  
- Mobile touch support enhancements.  
- Visual themes and customization options.
